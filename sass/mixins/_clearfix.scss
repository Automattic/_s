     * Make this element self-clearing.
     *
     * For modern browsers.
     * 1. The space content is one way to avoid an Opera bug when the
     *    contenteditable attribute is included anywhere else in the document.
     *    Otherwise it causes space to appear at the top and bottom of elements
     *    that are clearfixed.
     * 2. The use of `table` rather than `block` is only necessary if using
     *    `:before` to contain the top-margins of child elements.
     *
     * Dropped `*zoom: 1` used for IE 6â€“7 support, since I only support IE8+.
     *
     * See http://nicolasgallagher.com/micro-clearfix-hack/

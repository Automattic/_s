=== Huron for WordPress ===

Hi! I'm an example theme based off the (underscores WordPress theme)[http://underscores.me] to show you how you can integrate Huron into your WordPress development. We've tried to pare away the non-Huron related parts of the theme so you can see exactly what you need to set up your prototyping process.

== More about Huron ==

Huron is a front-end tool to generate prototypes and style guides using Webpack.

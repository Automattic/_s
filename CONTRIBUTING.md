Thank-you for taking the time to contribute to _s. Here are a few guidelines to keep in mind when submitting issues and pull requests:

- _s only supports Internet Exporter versions 9 and greater. Please don't open issues that deal with lesser versions of Internet Exporter.
- Having multiple `<h1>` tags in a page is valid by the HTML5 spec, and this is something that we will not be changing.
- The preferred method of generating a new theme based on _s is the [Underscores.me](http://underscores.me) website. If you have an alternative method, such as a shell script, feel free to write a blog post about it or host it in a separate repo.
- If your issue is specific to the [Underscores.me](http://underscores.me) website, please open a pull request on the [Underscores.me GitHub repository](https://github.com/Automattic/underscores.me) instead of here.

You can see all contributors to _s [listed on the Underscores.me](http://underscores.me/#contribute) website along with their GitHub avatars, ordered by amount of contributions. Please ensure that you have an email address added to both GitHub and your local Git installation to be recognized for your contributions.

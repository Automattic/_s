Thanks for contributing to `_s` (Underscores) — you rock!

## Submitting issues
Before submitting your issue, make sure it has not been discussed earlier. You can search for existing tickets [here](https://github.com/Automattic/_s/search).

Here are some tips to consider and to help you write a great report:

* `_s` supports Internet Explorer 9 and greater, as well as the latest two versions of all other major browsers.
* `_s` is backwards compatible with the two versions prior to the current stable version of WordPress.
* `_s` uses HTML5 markup.
* We decided not to include translations [[#50](https://github.com/Automattic/_s/pull/50)] beyond the exisiting `_s.pot` file, a RTL stylesheet [[#263](https://github.com/Automattic/_s/pull/263)], or editor styles [[#225](https://github.com/Automattic/_s/pull/225)], as they are likely to change during development of an `_s`-based theme.

## Contibuting code

Found a bug you can fix? Fantastic! Patches are always welcome. Here's a few tips for crafting a great pull request:

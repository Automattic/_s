== Description ==

The easiest way to start creating themes with Mr.Dev.'s Framework!

Mr.Dev. grabbed Underscores, the famous starter theme for Wordpress, and made it fully compatible with his Framework.

Some key differences:
- No default widgets/sidebars/sections - This is to better follow the new workflow on Wordpress (using blocks and reusable blocks per page instead of widgets) and to prepare for the full site editor. You can still create new sidebars/sections using "layout control" on Mr.Dev.'s Framework, or set your defaults on a child theme by uncommenting "add_action( 'widgets_init', '_s_widgets_init' )" on "functions.php".
- No forced logo or menu in the header - You can use widgets instead. Create new sidebars/sections for those widgets using "layout control" on Mr.Dev.'s Framework.
- Auto dropdown menu - With Mr.Dev_s any default menu widget located inside ".mr-header" will automatically become a structured dropdown menu.

== Installation ==

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New button.
2. Click Upload Theme and Choose File, then select the theme's .zip file. Click Install Now.
3. Click Activate to use your new theme right away.
